# Trinsic's API Quickstart
This demo shows how to add Streetcred API calls into a nodejs app with our service client. It also shows a webhook implementation can create automated workflows in your app. 

## Use Case
In this simple use case, you control a (very simple) issuer portal for your organization, which can issue a business card to anyone with a mobile wallet in your organization. Once a business card is issued, that holder can do business card verifications to other peers using the Streetcred mobile app. 

## Prerequisites:
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)


### Register your organization
 1. Create a new organization and select the Sovrin Staging Network.
 
 2. In the .env file, add your organization's subscription key to the `SUBKEY` field and the access token to the `ACCESSTOK` field.
    
### Create a credential definition with Swaggerhub
 1. Retrieve your organization's Access Token and Subscription Key on the Organization page

   Bart will provide
